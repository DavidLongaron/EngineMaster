# EngineMaster
This is an engine created by David Longaron Lorente for the Master Advanced Programming for AAA Video Games at the Universitat Polit√©cnica de Catalunya.
You can find this project [here]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5L3fkxHlPSs](https://github.com/MrDfu/EngineMaster)). 
This project uses the following libraries:

- SDL v2.0.16
- Glew v2.1.0
- MathGeo.lib v1.5
- DirectXTex v2.0.1
- TinyGltf 2.8.10
- OpenGL v4.60
- ImGui v1.89.9


With this engine you can interact it in three ways:

-Move the camera:
You can control the camera with the keys "w,a,s,d" to go horizontally and vertically and "q,e" to go up and down. Also if you move the mouse while keeping the right click down you can rotate the camera around.

-Interact with the menu:
The menu includes a `Log` a `Help` menu with various options that takes you to the GitHub repository, an `Edit Model` that allows you to change the size and rotation of the model and a `Performance` to check on the current framerate.

-Loading Models:
To use the engine you only need to drag and drop the tiny gltf files included in the mnodels folders into the windows to load them. By default a model of a Bakery House is going to be preloaded.
If the model is too big or to small you can use the Edit Model tab of the menu to resize it to a more appropiate size.
